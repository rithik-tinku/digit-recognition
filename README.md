# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN  

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from images. 
It is trained on the MNIST dataset and can predict custom digit images. 
The model is built with TensorFlow and Keras, and the input images are preprocessed using PIL and NumPy.
NOTE:
TensorFlow does not support Python 3.13 yet. The latest supported versions are Python 3.8â€“3.11.
Solution: Use Python 3.10 or 3.11
